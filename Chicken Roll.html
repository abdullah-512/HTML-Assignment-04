    <h1>Chicken Roll</h1>
    <p>
        Chicken roll is a popular and delicious street food made by wrapping spiced, cooked chicken in a soft flatbread or paratha. The chicken is usually marinated with a blend of flavorful spices and herbs, then grilled or sautéed to tender perfection. The roll is often filled with fresh vegetables like onions, tomatoes, and lettuce, and topped with tangy sauces or chutneys for an extra kick. Easy to eat on the go and packed with bold flavors, chicken rolls are a favorite snack or quick meal enjoyed in many South Asian countries and beyond.
