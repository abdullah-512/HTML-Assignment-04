    <h1>Chicken Korma</h1>
    <p>
        Chicken Korma is a rich and creamy South Asian curry known for its delicate blend of spices and luxurious texture. Made by slow-cooking chicken in a sauce of yogurt, cream, ground nuts, and fragrant spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves, it delivers a mild yet flavorful taste. The dish is often garnished with toasted nuts and fresh herbs, making it both visually appealing and delicious. Chicken Korma is traditionally served with rice or naan bread and is a popular choice for festive occasions and special meals due to its indulgent and aromatic qualities.
