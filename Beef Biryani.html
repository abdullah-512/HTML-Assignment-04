    <h1>Beef Biryani</h1>
    <p>
        Beef Biryani is a hearty and flavorful South Asian dish made by layering tender, spiced beef with fragrant basmati rice and slow-cooking it to perfection. The beef is typically marinated in yogurt and a blend of aromatic spices like cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and chili powder, then cooked until soft and juicy. This is combined with rice that's often flavored with saffron or turmeric, creating a vibrant and rich dish. Garnished with fried onions, fresh herbs, and sometimes boiled eggs, Beef Biryani is a festive and satisfying meal enjoyed on special occasions and family gatherings for its deep, savory taste and irresistible aroma.
