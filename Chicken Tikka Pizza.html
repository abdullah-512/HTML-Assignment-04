    <h1>Chicken Tikka Pizza</h1>
    <p>
        Chicken Tikka Pizza is a delicious fusion of Italian and South Asian flavors, combining the rich, spicy taste of chicken tikka with the cheesy, savory appeal of classic pizza. The pizza is topped with chunks of marinated and grilled chicken tikka, along with vegetables like onions and bell peppers, layered over a base of tomato sauce and melted mozzarella cheese. Baked until the crust is crisp and the cheese is bubbling, it offers a perfect balance of smoky, spicy, and creamy flavors. Loved by fans of both cuisines, Chicken Tikka Pizza is a popular choice for those craving something bold and satisfying.
