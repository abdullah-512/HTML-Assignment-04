    <h1>Beef Korma</h1>
    <p>
        Beef Korma is a rich and flavorful dish from South Asian cuisine, where tender pieces of beef are slow-cooked in a creamy, spiced gravy made with yogurt, cream, ground nuts, and a blend of aromatic spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. This slow cooking process allows the beef to absorb the rich flavors while becoming melt-in-the-mouth tender. The sauce’s smooth and silky texture, combined with the warm spices, makes Beef Korma a comforting and indulgent meal. It is often served with naan, roti, or steamed rice and is a popular choice for festive occasions and special gatherings.
