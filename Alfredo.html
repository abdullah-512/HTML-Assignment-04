    <h1>Alfredo</h1>
    <p>
        Alfredo is a rich and creamy pasta dish that originated in Italy but has become especially popular in American cuisine. Traditionally made with fettuccine noodles, the sauce is prepared using butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese, creating a smooth, velvety texture and a mild, comforting flavor. Often served with grilled chicken, shrimp, or vegetables, Alfredo is a hearty and satisfying meal. Its simplicity and indulgent taste make it a favorite for both home cooking and restaurant dining, offering a delicious balance of creaminess and savory depth.
