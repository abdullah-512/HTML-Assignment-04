    <h1>Chicken Kabab</h1>
    <p>
        Chicken kabab is a savory dish made from boneless pieces of chicken that are marinated in a blend of spices, yogurt, and lemon juice, then grilled or roasted to perfection. The marinade infuses the chicken with rich flavors, making it tender, juicy, and slightly smoky. Popular in Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Mediterranean cuisines, chicken kababs are often served with naan, rice, or salad, and accompanied by sauces like mint chutney or garlic dip. Easy to prepare and full of flavor, chicken kababs are a favorite for both everyday meals and special occasions.
