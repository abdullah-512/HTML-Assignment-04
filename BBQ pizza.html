    <h1>BBQ pizza</h1>
    <p>
        BBQ pizza is a delicious twist on traditional pizza, featuring a smoky barbecue sauce base instead of the usual tomato sauce. It’s typically topped with grilled chicken or other meats, red onions, mozzarella cheese, and sometimes cilantro or bell peppers, creating a perfect balance of sweet, tangy, and savory flavors. Baked until the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted and bubbly, BBQ pizza offers a rich, smoky taste that’s both comforting and satisfying. Popular at casual gatherings and pizza nights, it’s a favorite for those who enjoy bold, hearty flavors with a touch of smoky sweetness.
