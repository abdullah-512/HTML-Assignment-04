    <h1>Chicken Burger</h1>
    <p>
        A Chicken Burger is a tasty and satisfying sandwich made with a seasoned chicken patty placed inside a fresh burger bun, often topped with lettuce, tomato, onions, and sauces like mayonnaise or ketchup. The chicken patty can be grilled or fried, giving it a juicy or crispy texture depending on preference. Sometimes cheese, pickles, or coleslaw are added to enhance the flavor. Popular as a quick meal or fast-food option, the Chicken Burger is enjoyed by people of all ages and is often served with fries and a cold drink for a complete and delicious meal.
