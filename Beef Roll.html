    <h1>Beef Roll</h1>
    <p>
        Beef roll is a popular and flavorful street food made by wrapping tender, spiced beef in a soft, flaky flatbread or paratha. The beef is usually marinated with a mix of aromatic spices and cooked until juicy and flavorful, then rolled up with fresh onions, herbs, and sometimes tangy chutneys or sauces to add an extra layer of taste. This handheld snack is loved for its rich, savory flavor and satisfying texture, making it a favorite quick meal or snack option in many South Asian and Middle Eastern countries.
