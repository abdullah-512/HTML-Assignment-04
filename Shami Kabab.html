    <h1>Shami Kabab</h1>
    <p>
        Shami Kabab is a popular South Asian dish made from finely ground meat, usually beef or chicken, combined with chana dal (split chickpeas), herbs, and a mix of spices. The mixture is cooked, blended into a smooth paste, shaped into flat patties, and then shallow-fried until golden and crispy on the outside while remaining soft on the inside. Known for its rich taste and tender texture, Shami Kabab is often served with naan, paratha, or as a side with rice dishes, and pairs well with mint chutney and onions. It’s a favorite in Pakistani and Indian households, especially during special occasions and festive meals.
