    <h1>Chicken Biryani</h1>
    <p>
        Chicken Biryani is a popular and aromatic rice dish made with fragrant basmati rice, tender chicken pieces, and a rich blend of spices like turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The chicken is usually marinated in yogurt and spices, then cooked and layered with partially cooked rice before being slow-cooked together, allowing the flavors to blend beautifully. Often garnished with fried onions, fresh coriander, and boiled eggs, Chicken Biryani is a festive and satisfying meal enjoyed across South Asia and around the world for its bold taste and enticing aroma.
