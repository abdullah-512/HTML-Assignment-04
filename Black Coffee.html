    <h1>Black Coffee</h1>
    <p>
        Black coffee is a simple yet bold beverage made by brewing coffee beans without adding any milk, cream, or sugar. Known for its strong, rich flavor and slightly bitter taste, black coffee allows the natural aromas and nuances of the coffee beans to shine through. It’s a popular choice for those who appreciate a pure coffee experience and want a low-calorie, no-frills caffeine boost. Often enjoyed hot, black coffee can also be served cold and is favored for its straightforward, intense flavor and invigorating effect.
