    <h1>Chicken Karahi</h1>
    <p>
        Chicken Karahi is a popular and flavorful dish from Pakistani and North Indian cuisine, known for its rich, spicy taste and vibrant aroma. It is prepared by cooking chicken in a traditional wok-like pan called a "karahi" with fresh tomatoes, green chilies, ginger, garlic, and a blend of bold spices. The dish is cooked on high heat, which helps intensify the flavors and reduce the tomatoes into a thick, tangy masala that clings to the chicken. Often garnished with fresh coriander and ginger slices, Chicken Karahi is typically enjoyed with naan or chapati and is a favorite at family meals and festive gatherings.
