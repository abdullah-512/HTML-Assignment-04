    <h1>White Karahi</h1>
    <p>
        White Karahi is a delicious and creamy dish from Pakistani cuisine, known for its rich flavor and distinctive white appearance. Unlike traditional red karahi, White Karahi is made without tomatoes or red chili powder, using yogurt, cream, green chilies, black pepper, garlic, and ginger to create a smooth and mildly spiced gravy. The chicken is cooked until tender in this flavorful base, resulting in a dish that is both aromatic and comforting. Often garnished with fresh coriander and julienned ginger, White Karahi is typically served with naan or paratha and is a favorite for those who enjoy milder yet deeply satisfying flavors.
